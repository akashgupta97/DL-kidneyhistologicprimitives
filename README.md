# Deep Learning-based segmentation of kidney histologic primitives on multiple stains


The assessment of renal biopsy is unique compared to other surgical pathology specimens because of the variety of stains routinely used. Morphologic assessment of such histological preparations relies on the quality of the preparations itself, and the expertise of the pathologist in detecting the individual structures and associated changes. The authors demonstrate the generalizability of “Deep Learning-based Convolutional Neural Networks” for segmentation of multiple different normal histologic structures from multiple stained whole slide images of kidney biopsies generated across 38 histology laboratories, in turn reflecting substantial morphologic, stain and tissue heterogeneity.
